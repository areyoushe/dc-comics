            <h2>RED HOOD : OUTLAW</h2>
            <p>It’s the end of the Outlaw era! Magic and metahumans are everywhere, but good and evil are easy to spot-right? Red Hood and the Outlaws are about to discover that the line between moral and immoral is very thin indeed. Red Hood, Artemis, and Bizarro have battled many threats together...but they’ve never faced a veritable army of the damned! Which is what is happening during the protests on the streets of Qurac as the Untitled prepare to strike at the heart of humanity! It’s a battle that will take the Outlaws literally to hell-but will they be able to find their way back? Collects Red Hood: Outlaw #43-50.</p>
